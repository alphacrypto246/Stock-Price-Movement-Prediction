# Stock Price Movement Prediction

This project aims to predict stock price movements using **Polynomial Regression**. The model is built to analyze and forecast stock price trends based on historical data and other relevant factors, providing insights that can aid in making informed trading decisions.

## Project Overview
Predicting stock price movements is a challenging task due to the volatility and non-linear nature of financial markets. This project leverages historical stock data and applies **Polynomial Regression** to capture complex relationships between features and the target variable. The goal is to assist traders, analysts, and financial enthusiasts in making data-driven decisions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparation of historical stock price data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extraction of meaningful features to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Polynomial Regression**: A flexible regression model to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
- **Visualization**: Clear visual representation of the predictions compared to actual stock prices.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries are utilized in this project:

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing Polynomial Regression and other machine learning tasks.

## Requirements
To run the project, you need the following libraries installed:

```bash
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alphacrypto246/Stock-Price-Movement-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Stock-Price-Movement-Prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `main.ipynb`.
2. Load the dataset by following the instructions in the notebook.
3. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Visualize the results and interpret the predictions.

## File Structure
- `main.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the implementation of the model.
- `data/`: Folder to store the stock price dataset (not included in the repository).
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Dataset
Ensure you have access to a dataset with historical stock price information. The dataset should include features like:
- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume

You can source datasets from platforms like Yahoo Finance or Kaggle.

## Results
The project demonstrates the ability of Polynomial Regression to capture and predict stock price trends with reasonable accuracy. Plots comparing predicted and actual prices showcase the model's performance.
